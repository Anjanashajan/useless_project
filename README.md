# LANDSLIDE PREDICTION SYSTEM üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Heisters

### Project Description
A Landslide Prediction System that uses advanced algorithms to let people know when it's time to cancel their mountain hike plans‚Äîor maybe just grab a helmet!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever found yourself standing on a hill and wondering, "Will this slope decide to slide me down today?" We're solving that age-old (nonexistent) problem by predicting landslides before they start! Now you can confidently say, "Not today, gravity!"

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using complex algorithms, location data, and a sprinkle of "science," our system gives you the power to detect landslides before they ruin your day! Just type in your location, hit CHECK, and boom‚Äîyour phone tells you whether to hike bravely or run for cover! Because who doesn't want a virtual fortune-teller for landslides?

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages used: Python, HTML<br>
Frameworks used: Flask (for the web application)<br>
Libraries used: Pandas (for data handling), Joblib (for model loading)<br>
Tools used: Flask development server, Jupyter Notebook (for model training and testing)<br>

### Implementation
For Software

# Installation

Install required Python packages:<br>
pip install flask pandas joblib<br>

Ensure landslide_model.pkl and landslide_data.csv are in the project directory.<br>
# Run
Start the Flask app with:<br>
python app.py<br>
### Project Documentation
For Software
Architecture: The application accepts a location input, retrieves corresponding environmental features, and uses a machine learning model to predict landslide risk.<br>
Model Details: The app uses a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree) trained on environmental factors like rainfall, slope, humidity, and soil moisture.<br>
Error Handling: If the entered location is not found in the dataset, the app returns an error message: "Location not found in the dataset." This ensures graceful handling of user errors or incomplete data.<br>

# Screenshots 
1. Main Page
