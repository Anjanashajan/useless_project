### Project Description
A Landslide Prediction System that uses advanced algorithms to let people know when it's time to cancel their mountain hike plansâ€”or maybe just grab a helmet!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever found yourself standing on a hill and wondering, "Will this slope decide to slide me down today?" We're solving that age-old (nonexistent) problem by predicting landslides before they start! Now you can confidently say, "Not today, gravity!"

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using complex algorithms, location data, and a sprinkle of "science," our system gives you the power to detect landslides before they ruin your day! Just type in your location, hit CHECK, and boomâ€”your phone tells you whether to hike bravely or run for cover! Because who doesn't want a virtual fortune-teller for landslides?
